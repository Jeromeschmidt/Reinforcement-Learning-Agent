## 🚀 Getting Started


## 💻 Local Development

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Andre-Williams22/Reinforcement-Learning-Agent
``` 
```bash
# cd into the repo
cd Reinforecement-Learning-Agent
```
```bash
# cd into the program locally
cd rl
```
```bash
# train the program
python3 linear_rl_trader.py -m train
```
```bash
